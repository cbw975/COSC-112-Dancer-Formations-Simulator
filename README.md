# COSC-112-Dancer-Formations-Simulator
Our project is a dance-formation simulator. One of the most time-consuming aspects of dance performance is setting formations. This is a tool for a choreographer to use to help set formations. Generally, the choreographer knows what shapes they want to form, but putting people in certain places and figuring out who will go where in transitions is very time consuming. This simulator will have the choreographer input formations by clicking on the screen where they want the dancers to be. They also input additional information for their dancers, adding in names and choosing their representative color. They then select the next formations and can continue for as many formations as they wish. The program takes in all of this information and displays the dancers from a top-down view, showing where each dancer should be at each formation, and also animates the full transitions between formations. In order to make sure people donâ€™t travel far, it will perform a regression algorithm to find the smallest cumulative distance between points. In doing so, it will save the choreographer and dancers lots of time.
